# Fursuit_dryer
An open source model for a tool that can dry up to 2 fursuits simultaneously.

## Special thanks
A very special thanks to the persons who made the super fursuit dryer at  [CesFur 2019](https://www.cesfur.org/en/). The one I built was mainly inspired from them.

Another special thanks to [Yashn37](https://twitter.com/Yashn37) who made all the 3D models using Blender.

## Material
This fursuit dryer is made of easy-to-find pipes commonly used for liquid flow. You can find them in do-it-yourself stores for a cheap price.
- The big straight pipes have a diameter of 100mm;
- The medium straight pipes have a diameter of 50mm;
- The medium inclined pipes have a diameter of 50mm;
- The small straight rigid pipes have a diameter of 30mm;
- The small inclined rigid pipes have a diameter of 30mm;
- The small flexible pipes have a diameter of 30mm and have been retrieved from a swiming pool.

The wood boards and metal hooks come from do-it-yourself stores.

The flexible pipes from ventilation to the dryer comes from do-it-yourself stores and is made for hose ventilation.

The ventilation has been purchased on Amazon and is made for house ventilation (called "VMC" in french).

**Note on the ventilation:**
After several tests, it turns out that the chosen type of ventilation is a bit weak for the purpose. This type of device is made to suck in air with no resistance, not to blow it in fursuit parts. This case of use is not adapted and the ventilation encounters difficulties to blow air. I recommend to use a stronger type of ventilation, such as centrifugal fan.

## 3D parts
The 3D parts have been made on Blender by [Yashn37](https://twitter.com/Yashn37). The files are on STL format and can be printed by any 3D printer due to their low complexity.

Their purpose is to strengthen the inclined pipes because of the weight that rests on them.

## Assembly
The 3D printed parts and inclined pipes are glued together. The hooks are screwed in the pipe.

The dryer can be mounted and unmounted very quickly in few steps.
